# Seasonal Influenza Forecasting
Influenza(flu) is an infectious respiratory illness that impacts the US every year. How significant the flu's impact will be, and when the flu season peaks, varies from season to season, making it challenging to prepare and respond to the influenza outbreaks. Precise and timely forecasting of seasonal and short-term targets can help take proactive measures and potentially reduce the flu's impact. We aim to forecast the seasonal targets onset week, peak week, and peak intensity in this project.
